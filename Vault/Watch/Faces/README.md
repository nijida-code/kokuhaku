# Vault / Watch / Faces

This directory contains **Apple Watch Face preset artifacts** and related documentation.

Important:
- These presets are **configurations of existing Apple Watch faces**.
- Kokuhaku does **not** create custom Watch Face types (Apple does not allow that for third-party apps).
- Our presets are meant to pair with Kokuhaku Complications for step-oriented glance views.

Subdirectories:
- `Presets/`      Exported `.watchface` files (installable presets)
- `Screenshots/`  Reference images for docs and future in-app galleries
- `Design/`       Rationale and design notes (iteration history)
